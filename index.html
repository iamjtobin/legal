    <h1>Legal Perspective: Candidate Ghosting and Contract Cancellation</h1>

    <div class="post">
    
   <h2>Standing Up Against Candidate Ghosting</h2>
<p class="highlight">
  It’s about time someone stood up to employers who ghost candidates. Silence is not professionalism. Accountability is overdue.
</p>
<p class="highlight">
  Ghosting isn't just impolite — it's a breach of trust. Whether you're a candidate or a recruiter, everyone who contributes to hiring deserves acknowledgment and respect. It’s time to end the silence and demand transparency.
</p>

      <h2>Summary of Events</h2>
      <p>A headhunting firm, known for personalised search and deep client engagement, proactively sources candidates using tailored narratives and direct market engagement — not generic outreach. They had previously introduced somone successfully for a manager in the Sydney office, with no prior issues. However, during a new engagement with the same manager, things took an unexpected turn: after introducing two candidates, the firm’s contract was abruptly terminated in an unusually abrupt manner.

The manager had mentioned open roles in Amsterdam and possibly Sydney, although spoke about the possibility of relocating someone from India, where the company operates a related business. The employer later advertised the Sydney role anyway.

Notably, one of the candidates introduced by the headhunting firm was suitable for a role in the employer’s Tokyo office—a position that has been actively advertised on their site since December 2024. At the time of writing it is July 2025.  Furthermore this candidate alone would have been suitable for other country locations.  They were British but spoke Japanese and were in Asia at the time.  </p>
      <p>The fallout may have stemmed from conflicts with another hiring manager whose behaviour included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rejecting qualified candidates on unfounded grounds;</li>
        <li>Frequently changing hiring location requirements;</li>
        <li>Making inappropriate comments about candidates;</li>
        <li>Allegedly describing the role as “shovelling horse shit” during an interview.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These concerns were escalated to HR and the now-retired CTO. It is possible that the aforementioned manager now has more influence in the business.</p>



<h2>Candidate Match & Location Confusion</h2>
<p>The headhunting firm introduced a candidate who matched the job description exceptionally well—based on direct dialogue with the hiring manager and tailored recruitment insight. By objective standards, including evaluation via advanced language models, their fit ranked at the highest level.</p>
<p>Despite the manager's initial emphasis on sourcing Amsterdam-based talent, the employer subsequently advertised the same role in both Amsterdam and London. This inconsistency calls into question the internal alignment of hiring priorities and the transparency of the decision-making process.</p>

      <h2>Correspondence Summary</h2>
      <p>The headhunting firm issued a concise one-page letter. In response, the employer produced a defensive four-page document, asserting no obligation to provide feedback or engage further. This discrepancy in tone and volume raises legitimate concerns about accountability and transparency in recruitment processes.</p>

      <h2>Professional Conduct</h2>
      <p>Further attempts to clarify the cancellation and seek candidate feedback were met with comments from HR, remarking on the consultant’s presumed skin colour, gender, and calling the firm a “one-man band.” This behaviour undermines professionalism and may point to potential ethical and legal violations.</p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>Recruitment firms invest substantial time and effort — from understanding roles to engaging candidates — and deserve fair treatment. Ghosting candidates and suppliers damages trust and the broader hiring ecosystem.</p>

      <h2>Heart of the Issue</h2>
      <p>The lack of candidate feedback and/or progression is at the heart of the issue. The candidates were introduced while a valid recruitment agreement was in place.</p>

      <h2>Alternatives</h2>
      <p>In an effort to raise accountability, the recruitment firm submitted a formal request to the CIPD. The investigation has stalled, despite the severity of the issues raised. All supporting documents are accessible via the burger menu above.</p>
      
      <h2>Legal Action</h2>
      <p>A court claim has been issued by the recruitment firm. See the relevant documents via the burger menu above.</p>
